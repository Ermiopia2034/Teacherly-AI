# Frontend Progress Report - June 25, 2025

This document summarizes the recent development work on the Teacherly AI frontend and provides guidance for future development.

## Work Completed

### 1. "My Contents" Feature Implementation
- **Data Fetching and Display:**
  - The "My Contents" page (`/dashboard/my-contents`) was implemented to fetch and display a list of the authenticated teacher's generated content.
  - The content is displayed in a grid of cards, showing the title and type of each item.

- **Content Detail View:**
  - A dynamic detail page (`/dashboard/my-contents/[id]`) was created to show the full view of a single content item.
  - The page fetches the specific content by its ID from the backend.
  - It uses the `react-markdown` library to correctly render the content received from the backend.

### 2. API Integration Layer
- **Content Service:** A new API service file (`src/lib/api/content.ts`) was created to handle all communication with the backend's `/api/content` endpoints. It includes functions for fetching the list of content and fetching a single content item by ID.

### 3. Redux State Management
- **Content Slice:** A new Redux slice (`src/lib/features/content/contentSlice.ts`) was created to manage all state related to content.
  - It handles the state for both the list of contents and the currently selected content item, including `isLoading`, `error`, and data states for each.
  - It uses `createAsyncThunk` to handle the asynchronous API calls in a standardized way.
- **Store Update:** The new `contentReducer` was successfully integrated into the main Redux store (`src/lib/store.ts`).

### 4. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Clickable Content Cards:** The cards on the "My Contents" list page are now interactive, implemented as links that navigate the user to the corresponding detail page.
- **Styling:** Custom styling was added for both the list page and the new detail page using CSS Modules to ensure component-level scope and prevent style conflicts.

### 5. Markdown Rendering and Theme Refactor
- **Markdown Rendering Engine:**
  - The `react-markdown` implementation was significantly upgraded to handle complex notations.
  - A new, reusable `MarkdownRenderer` component was created in `src/components/common/MarkdownRenderer`.
  - Added and configured essential plugins: `remark-gfm` (for tables, etc.), `rehype-highlight` (for code blocks), `rehype-slug`, and `rehype-autolink-headings`.
- **Dark Theme Consistency:**
  - The "My Contents" list and detail pages were refactored to align with the application's global dark theme.
  - The reusable `Card` component (`src/components/ui/Card`) was updated to use CSS variables from `globals.css`, removing its hardcoded light theme.
  - All text visibility issues on dark backgrounds were resolved.
- **Styling Enhancements:**
  - The visual presentation of code blocks and tables was improved to ensure they are distinct and readable on the dark background, with enhanced borders and contrast.
- **Bug Fixes and Cleanup:**
  - Fixed a `react/no-unescaped-entities` compilation error.
  - Resolved a CSS linting error by removing an empty ruleset.

## Guidance for Future Development

- **Redux Pattern for Data Fetching:** When adding features that require data from the backend, follow the established pattern:
  1.  Add a new function to the relevant API service file in `src/lib/api/`.
  2.  Create a new `async thunk` in the appropriate Redux slice (`src/lib/features/`).
  3.  Add cases to the `extraReducers` in the slice to handle the thunk's `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected` states.
  4.  In the component, use `useDispatch` to dispatch the thunk and `useSelector` to get the data and loading states from the store.

- **Component Structure:** Continue to adhere to the existing component architecture:
  - **`src/components/ui/`:** For small, reusable, presentational components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`).
  - **`src/components/features/`:** For components tied to a specific application domain.
  - **`src/components/common/`:** For shared utility components.
  - Always use CSS Modules for component-specific styling.

- **API Client:** Use the pre-configured Axios instance (`apiClient` from `src/lib/api/client.ts`) for all backend requests. It is set up with `withCredentials: true`, which is essential for sending the authentication cookie to the backend.

- **Rendering Markdown:** The backend frequently returns content in Markdown format. Always use the new **`MarkdownRenderer`** component (`src/components/common/MarkdownRenderer`) to render this content. This ensures consistent styling, security, and full support for complex notations like tables and highlighted code blocks.

- **Theme Consistency:** When creating new components or pages, strictly adhere to the CSS variables defined in `src/app/globals.css` for all colors, fonts, and backgrounds. Avoid hardcoding style values to ensure the application maintains a consistent look and feel.
