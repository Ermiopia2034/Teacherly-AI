// This file will contain API service functions related to student data management.
// For example, functions to:
// - Fetch a list of students
// - Get details for a specific student
// - Add a new student
// - Update student information
// - Delete a student

// Example placeholder structure:
/*
export interface Student {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // ... other student properties
}

export const getStudents = async (): Promise<Student[]> => {
  const response = await apiClient.get('/students');
  return response.data;
};

export const getStudentById = async (studentId: string): Promise<Student> => {
  const response = await apiClient.get(`/students/${studentId}`);
  return response.data;
};
*/

// Add your student-specific API functions here as they are developed.
