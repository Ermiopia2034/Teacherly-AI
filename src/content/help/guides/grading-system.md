# AI Grading System Guide

Learn how to leverage our advanced AI grading system to streamline assessment and provide consistent, fair grading.

## Understanding AI Grading

### What It Does
Our AI grading system can:
- **Analyze handwritten responses** with OCR technology
- **Grade multiple choice questions** automatically
- **Evaluate essay structure and content**
- **Provide detailed feedback** on submissions
- **Ensure consistent grading** across all students

### Supported Assignment Types
- Multiple choice tests
- Short answer questions
- Essay assignments
- Math problems with work shown
- Fill-in-the-blank exercises
- Diagram labeling

## Setting Up AI Grading

### Creating an Assessment
1. Navigate to **Grading > New Assessment**
2. Fill in assessment details:
   - Assessment name
   - Subject/course
   - Total points possible
   - Due date
   - Grading rubric

### Upload Methods
Choose your upload method:
- **Bulk Upload**: Multiple student submissions at once
- **Individual Upload**: One submission at a time
- **Batch Scanning**: Multiple pages per student
- **Photo Import**: Mobile device captures

## File Requirements

### Supported Formats
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, HEIC (high resolution preferred)
- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX
- **Scans**: 300 DPI or higher recommended

### Best Practices for Image Quality
- **Good lighting**: Avoid shadows and glare
- **Clear focus**: Ensure text is sharp and readable
- **Proper orientation**: Images should be right-side up
- **Full page capture**: Include entire assignment
- **Contrast**: Dark text on light background works best

## AI Grading Process

### Step 1: Document Analysis
The AI system:
- Performs OCR on handwritten text
- Identifies question boundaries
- Recognizes student information
- Maps content to rubric criteria

### Step 2: Content Evaluation
For each response, AI analyzes:
- **Accuracy**: Correctness of answers
- **Completeness**: Thoroughness of responses
- **Understanding**: Depth of comprehension
- **Methodology**: Problem-solving approach

### Step 3: Score Generation
The system provides:
- Individual question scores
- Overall assignment grade
- Confidence ratings
- Detailed feedback comments
- Improvement suggestions

## Review and Adjustment

### Confidence Scores
AI provides confidence levels:
- **High (90-100%)**: Very reliable, minimal review needed
- **Medium (70-89%)**: Generally accurate, spot check recommended
- **Low (0-69%)**: Requires manual review and verification

### Manual Review Process
1. **Review flagged items** (low confidence scores)
2. **Verify questionable responses**
3. **Adjust scores** if necessary
4. **Add personalized feedback**
5. **Approve final grades**

### Common Adjustments
- Handwriting recognition errors
- Context-dependent answers
- Creative or unexpected responses
- Partial credit scenarios
- Cultural or linguistic considerations

## Rubric Integration

### Creating Effective Rubrics
Design rubrics with:
- **Clear criteria**: Specific, measurable standards
- **Point distributions**: Logical point allocations
- **Performance levels**: Distinguished, proficient, developing, beginning
- **Descriptive language**: Clear expectations for each level

### AI Rubric Mapping
The system maps responses to:
- Specific rubric criteria
- Performance level indicators
- Point value ranges
- Feedback categories
